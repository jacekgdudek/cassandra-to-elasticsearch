**FORKED FROM [felipead/cassandra-to-elasticsearch](https://github.com/felipead/cassandra-to-elasticsearch)**


REQUIREMENTS
------------

- Cassandra 2.1+
- Elasticsearch 1.4+
- Python 2.7 (*Python 3 is not supported yet because of the legacy [time-uuid](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/time-uuid/) package*)

RATIONALE
---------

### Performance

Traditional sync methods usually query the whole Cassandra database and then compare each row against the Elasticsearch database, which is very inefficient. Even if we restrict the query to match rows with a minimum timestamp, this is still an expensive operation due to Cassandra's distributed nature.

To solve this issue I created a custom trigger that automatically tracks all commits made on any Cassandra table that has the trigger enabled. Changes are recorded in a log table which is optimized to efficiently retrieve updates by timestamp order.

This is the schema of the log table:

        CREATE TABLE log (
            time_uuid timeuuid,
            logged_keyspace text,
            logged_table text,
            logged_key text,
            operation text,
            updated_columns set<text>,
            PRIMARY KEY ((logged_keyspace, logged_table, logged_key), time_uuid)
        ) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (time_uuid DESC);

which can be queried efficiently on Cassandra by:

        SELECT * FROM log WHERE time_uuid >= minTimeuuid('2015-03-01T00:35:00-03:00') ALLOW FILTERING;

LIMITATIONS
-----------

### Optimistic Concurrency Control

Currently, no [Optimistic Concurrency Control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control) is implemented, neither on Cassandra or Elasticsearch. This means that data can get corrupted if updated between a read and a save. 

Although this feature is not implemented, it is easy to add it on both databases.

From the Cassandra end we can use [lightweight transactions](https://www.datastax.com/documentation/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/dml/dml_about_transactions_c.html) to implement Optimistic Concurrency Control:

        UPDATE example.product
        SET name = 'Apple 15-inch MacBook Pro', price = 1999.99
        WHERE id = 'cbbeec5c-5861-464e-9308-0457cad56a77'
        IF timestamp = 1427228258871

If the `timestamp` field was changed after the read and before the update, the update will not be applied.

Elasticsearch has built-in Optimistic Concurrency Control support through a `_version` field. It also allows us to use [a timestamp from another database](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/master/optimistic-concurrency-control.html#_using_versions_from_an_external_system) as its version control.

        PUT /example/product/cbbeec5c-5861-464e-9308-0457cad56a77?version=1427228258871&version_type=external
        {
            "name": "Apple 15-inch MacBook Pro",
            "price":  "1999.99"
        }

One disadvantage is that your application code must keep the `_version` constantly updated with the current timestamp. We can't use Elasticsearch's built-in version numbering since both databases must rely on the same version number.

DATA MODELLING
--------------

### Requirements

1. Your Cassandra schema must mirror your Elasticsearch mapping for any tables and document types to be synchronized. This means the following must be the same:
    - Cassandra keyspace names and Elasticsearch index names
    - Cassandra table names and Elasticsearch document type names
    - Cassandra column names and Elasticsearch field names
    - Cassandra and Elasticsearch ids

2. Every Cassandra table to be synchronized must have: 
    - A single primary key column named `id`. Composite primary keys are not supported at the moment.
    - A timestamp column with name and type `timestamp`.
 
3. All `ids` must be unique. Supported types are: [UUID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier), integer and string.

4. Only simple column types are supported at the moment:
  
    - `integer` / `long`
    - `float` / `double`
    - `decimal` (must be mapped as `string` in Elasticsearch due to lack of support).
    - `boolean`
    - `string` / `text`
    - `date` / `timestamp`
    - `uuid` / `timeuuid` (must be mapped as `string` in Elasticsearch due to lack of support).

  Other types could work in theory, but were not tested yet.

5. Date-times must be saved in UTC timezone.

6. All your Elasticsearch mappings must explicitly enable the `_timestamp` field. This can be done using:

        "_timestamp": {"enabled": True, "store": True}

7. Your application code must update the *timestamp* fields whenever an entity is created or updated. The sync service requires all tables and doc types to have a timestamp, otherwise it will fail.

### Example Data Model

Here's an example Cassandra schema:

        CREATE TABLE product (
            id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
            name text,
            quantity int,
            description text,
            price decimal,
            enabled boolean,
            external_id uuid,
            publish_date timestamp,
            timestamp timestamp
        )

This schema would be mapped to Elasticsearch as follows:

        $ curl -XPUT "http://localhost:9200/example/product/_mapping" -d '{
            "product": { 
                "_timestamp": { "enabled": true, "store": true },
                "properties": {
                    "name": {"type": "string"},
                    "description": {"type": "string"},
                    "quantity": {"type": "integer"},
                    "price": {"type": "string"},
                    "enabled": {"type": "boolean"},
                    "publish_date": {"type": "date"},
                    "external_id": {"type": "string"}
                }
            }
        }'
        
Notice that the UUID and decimal types on Cassandra are mapped on Elasticsearch as string. This is because Elasticsearch does not support these types natively. 

Please remember that, in general, decimal numbers should not be stored as floating point numbers. The precision loss induced by floating point arithmetic could cause a significant impact on financial and business applications. You can read more about it [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html).

APPLICATION
-----------

### Usage

At the first run the service performs a full sync from Cassandra to Elasticsearch. Depending on the volume of your data this might be a very time-consuming operation.

The following syncs are going to be incremental and much faster. The application automatically stores, at all times, the current sync state in a file called `state.yaml`. In case the service is interrupted for any reason, you can restart it and it will continue operation from the last saved state. The implemented data synchronization algorithms are idempotent, thus there is no risk on creating duplicates or corrupting the database by syncing data more than once.

### Configuration

By default the service tries to connect to Cassandra and Elasticsearch at the `localhost` using the respective standard ports and without authentication.

This can be changed by defining the following environment variables:

- `ELASTICSEARCH_URLS`: A list of connection URLs for each Elasticsearch server, separated by space. For instance: `"https://felipe:345%340@us-east-1.bonsai.io"`. If not defined, connects to localhost.
- `CASSANDRA_USERNAME`: The Cassandra username. Leave empty for no authentication.
- `CASSANDRA_PASSWORD`: The Cassandra password. Leave empty for no password.
- `CASSANDRA_PORT`: The Cassandra port. If not defined, uses default.
- `CASSANDRA_NODES`: A list of cassandra node ips, separated by space. For instance: `"192.168.0.100 192.168.0.3"`. If not defined, connects to localhost. 

You can customize other parameters by editing file `settings.yaml`.

### Setup

1. Install the [Cassandra Logger](http://github.com/felipead/cassandra-logger) into every node of your Cassandra cluster. This can be done by the following script:

        $ setup/install-cassandra-logger.sh {CASSANDRA_HOME}
    
  Where `{CASSANDRA_HOME}` is the directory of your Cassandra installation.  

2. Create the Cassandra Logger [schema](https://github.com/felipead/cassandra-logger/blob/master/create-log-schema.cql). This can be done by the following script:

        $ setup/create-cassandra-log-schema.sh {CASSANDRA_HOME}

3. For every Cassandra table that you want to synchronize, you need to create a logger trigger:

        CREATE TRIGGER logger ON product USING 'com.felipead.cassandra.logger.LogTrigger';

4. Setup Python and install dependencies through `pip`. You might want to use the `virtualenv` tool to create a virtual environment first.

        pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running
 
Start Cassandra and Elasticsearch, if they are not already running.

Run the service through the script (it will run in foreground):
 
    ./run.sh

AUTOMATED TESTS
---------------

First, install test dependencies through pip:

    pip install -r requirements.test.txt

Tests are split into black-box functional tests, which are very slow, and fast unit and integration tests.
 
To run only fast tests, use:
 
        ./test-fast.sh
        
To run all tests, use:

        ./test-slow.sh

You need to have both Cassandra and Elasticsearch running before running the tests.
